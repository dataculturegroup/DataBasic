The playful approach to the data helps engage the participants in thinking about how stories can be found and presented quickly, and helps people feel more freedom and flexibility about data presentations. It builds a notion of \"presentation\" instead of \"visualization\". The activity also builds the ability to translate words and numbers into structural forms. In addition, playing with these materials at the start of a workshop can break down power dynamics that might exist within the group.") }}</p>
